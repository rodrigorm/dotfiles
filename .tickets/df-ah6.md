# Reorganize AGENTS.md to match beads structure

Reorganized AGENTS.md to follow the same structure as the beads project AGENTS.md, including Project Overview, Development Guidelines, Issue Tracking, and Landing the Plane sections. Updated beads configuration to use 'df' prefix instead of 'dotfiles' and migrated all existing issues.
